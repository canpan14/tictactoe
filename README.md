Produce documentation in the form of a README, which must:

 Pin your repository on GitHub as a Popular Repository
Make sure it has a description so that employers can see it
 Link to your hosted game in the URL section of your Github repo.
 List technologies used
 Document your planning and tell a story about your development process and problem-solving strategy.
 List unsolved problems which would be fixed in future iterations.
 Link to wireframes and user stories.


Tic-Tac-Toe

Initial planning was mostly around local single player.
The idea was to make a very simple UI and focus on the game logic/functionality over the look.
Outside of small notification additionals, the UI mostly didn't change since day 1.
After the basic local gameplay was done I moved onto multiplayer.
That's when things went downhill.
I got multiplayer to work but the code became much more hacky than I would like.
Small issues and less than idea design decisions made in the early planning for just local play became road blocks.
Also there were a number of instances of reusing code written for local play for multiplayer.
That became an issue because any change made to multiplayer cause the need for a full retest of local play.

I used stack overflow, w3, and jquery docs for the majority of my help.
